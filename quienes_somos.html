			<h1>Sustainability has become a game-changer for NIKE</h1>
			<p> <img src="Imagenes/green.png" width="100" height="140">			
				We have a bold, audacious innovation ambition that fuels our creative design process, drives innovation and propels us into the future.
				We call this sustainable innovation.
				Climate change is a global issue that requires global solutions. Resource scarcity, fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and disruptions to supply chains are real concerns for business. And, we understand the broader impact that climate-related issues have on the athletes we serve.
				A sustainable economy is a low-carbon growth economy. Nike uses carbon as a leading indicator to assess sustainability, but we recognize sustainability goes way beyond carbon. It means addressing all our impacts on the environment and the communities where we operate, supporting labor rights in supply chains, while continuing to serve the athlete and our business.
				Sustainability and business growth are complementary.
			</p>
			<h1>When to compete</h1>
			<p>
				When Nike is innovating to gain a competitive edge, we focus on building innovation partnerships, investing in start-ups, emerging technologies and new science. We test and prototype solutions, and then take them to market.
